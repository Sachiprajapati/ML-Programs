Machine Learning Projects
This repository hosts a collection of machine learning projects completed as coursework. These projects explore various ML algorithms and techniques across different problem domains.

Projects Included
1. BPNN Classifier
Description: A Binary Classification model using a Backpropagation Neural Network.&lt;br>Demonstrates fundamental neural network training for a simple prediction task.

2. PCA and LDA
Description: Implementations of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA).&lt;br>Focuses on dimensionality reduction to simplify datasets and improve model efficiency.

3. Recommender System
Description: A basic recommender system for suggesting items.&lt;br>Illustrates core concepts behind personalized recommendations.

4. Sentiment Analysis
Description: A project focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP) to determine the sentiment (e.g., positive/negative) of text.&lt;br>Covers text preprocessing and classification for sentiment detection.

5. Clustering
Description: Exploration of various unsupervised clustering algorithms.&lt;br>Aims to group similar data points and discover inherent patterns within datasets.

How to Explore
Each project resides in its own folder. Inside, you'll typically find the code and a more detailed README.md specific to that project.
